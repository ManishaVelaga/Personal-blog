      <h5>My experience in Malaysia, Jan 30, 2023</h5>
      <img src="th (2).jpg">
      <p>The Global Immersion Program at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia was a
valuable learning experience that provided me with short courses in various fields
such as technical reporting, finance management, critical thinking skills, data
analysis, project management, and startup fundamentals.<br> These courses helped me
enhance my skills and gain practical knowledge in respective areas.<br>During the program, I also had the opportunity to visit several popular tourist destinations in Malaysia, including Ipoh, Penang, Batu Caves, and KLCC,Petronas
Towers. These visits provided a glimpse into the cultural richness and diversity of
Malaysia, and allowed me to experience the local customs, traditions, and way of
life.<br>
Ipoh, located in the state of Perak, was known for its stunning colonial architecture,
scenic parks, and delicious food. I was particularly impressed by the city's Old
Town, which was filled with beautifully restored buildings from the colonial era. The
street art and murals were also a highlight, as they added a vibrant and colorful
touch to the city's historic streets.<br>
Visiting the Batu Caves in Malaysia was a unique and awe-inspiring experience.
Climbing the steep staircase to reach the Temple Cave was a bit of a workout, but
the view from the top was worth it. From the entrance, I could see the lush greenery
of the surrounding hills and the cityscape in the distance.<br>
I had the opportunity to visit Petronas Towers, which are the tallest twin towers in
the world.The visit to the Petronas Towers was a memorable experience. The sleek
and modern design of the buildings, with their gleaming steel and glass fa√ßade, was
truly awe-inspiring.</p>
